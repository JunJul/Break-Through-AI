## Break Through Tech AI @ UCLA program is an one year extracurricular experience held by Cornell Tech. This program helps students to develop technical skills in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, so students can be proficient in the fastest-growing areas of tech: data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML).

## Break Through Tech AI @ UCLA program is divided into two section. The first section is called Machine Learning foundation where I learned modeling life-cycle, different machine learning algorithms, neural network, computer vision, and natural language processing. The second section is called AI studio where I am going to work with an industry partner and help an indsutry partner to solve their business requests in the Fall 2024.

## In the Machine Learning Foundation course, there are 9 topics. Unit 1 through 8 conists of quizzes, coding assignements, one written assginment, and one Lab, so I could practice what I learned.
### Unit1: [Learning modeling life cycle and practicing Numpy and Pandas](https://github.com/JunJul/Break-Through-Tech-AI/tree/Master/Unit1%20Machine%20Learning%20in%20a%20Nutshell)
### Unit2: [Data Preparation](https://github.com/JunJul/Break-Through-Tech-AI/tree/Master/Unit2%20Manage%20Data%20in%20ML)
### Unit3: [Clustering (KNN), Decision Tree](https://github.com/JunJul/Break-Through-Tech-AI/tree/Master/Unit3%20Train%20Common%20ML%20Models)
### Unit4: [Logistic Regression and Linear Regression](https://github.com/JunJul/Break-Through-Tech-AI/tree/Master/Unit4%20Train%20a%20Linear%20Model)
### Unit5: [Evaluations: Evaluation Metrics, Model Selection, Feature Selection](https://github.com/JunJul/Break-Through-Tech-AI/tree/Master/Unit5%20Evaluate%20and%20Deploy%20Your%20Model)
### Unit6: [Ensemble Models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Stacking](https://github.com/JunJul/Break-Through-Tech-AI/tree/Master/Unit6%20Ensemble%20Methods%20and%20Unsupervised%20Learning)
### Unit7: [Neural Network and Computer Vision](https://github.com/JunJul/Break-Through-Tech-AI/tree/Master/Unit7%20Deep%20Learning%20and%20Computer%20Vision)
### Unit8: [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/JunJul/Break-Through-Tech-AI/tree/Master/Unit8%20Deep%20Learning%20and%20Natural%20Language%20Processing)
### Unit9: Model Failure modes: imbalance classes, feature leakage, execution bottlenecks, and Concept drift
